# nosql-challenge
The establishment of the MongoDB was through the MongoDB Compass program instead of using command lines.  This was the method taught by the instructor.
The collections in my database was named 'establishment' instead of 'establishments'.  I remained with what I mistakenly named it throughout the assignment.
I commented out the inserting of the new restaurant as to not create duplication of the record when running and rerunning the script
I relied heavily on the class materials but did use ChatGPT and the Xxpert Learning Assistant.  I also received assistant from the instructor and TAs when I was stuck on an issue.
